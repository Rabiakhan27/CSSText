        <li class="heading">Meaning of Evolution:</li>
    
    <p class="para"> Evolution is the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.
        Evolution occurs when evolutionary processes such as natural selection and genetic drift act on genetic variation
        , resulting in certain characteristics becoming more or less common within a population over successive
         generations. The process of evolution has given rise to biodiversity at every level of biological
          organisation. </p>
          
          <li class="heading">Story of Human Evolution:</li>
          <p class="para">Human evolution is the lengthy process of change by which people originated from apelike ancestors.
             Scientific evidence shows that the physical and behavioral traits shared by all people originated from 
             apelike ancestors
             and evolved over a period of approximately six million years.
             Humans are primates. Physical and genetic similarities show that the modern human species,
              Homo sapiens, has a very close relationship to another group of primate species, the apes.
               Humans and the great apes (large apes) of Africa -- chimpanzees (including bonobos,
                or so-called “pygmy chimpanzees”) and gorillas -- share a common ancestor that lived 
                between 8 and 6 million years ago. Humans first evolved in Africa, and much of human 
                evolution occurred on that continent. The fossils of early humans who lived between 6 and 2 million years
              ago come entirely from Africa.
            </p>
          <li class="heading">Conclusion:</li>
          <p class="para">Studies in evolutionary biology have led to the conclusion that human beings arose
             from ancestral primates. This association was hotly debated among scientists in Darwin's day.
              But today there is no significant scientific doubt about the close evolutionary 
            relationships among all primates, including humans.
            Also according to our religion Islam God made Adam A.s from water and dust in a same perfect condition as
        man living now in the modern world. Thus this proves that there is no concept of evoluion but there might be changes 
    in Human genetics which causes variation in todays and old age human. </p>
